========================

For this project, I am diving into Webpack and AngularJS with ES6 and ESLint.

Difficulty arises from trying to couple AngularJS with Webpack, and at present I'm trying to create a vendor.js bundle containing angular with ngRoute and possibly other global vendor libraries which will be seperate from the bundled application js file.
