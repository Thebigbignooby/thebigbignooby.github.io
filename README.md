========================

For this project, I am diving into Webpack and AngularJS with ES6 and ESLint.

Difficulty arises from trying to couple AngularJS with Webpack, and at present I'm trying to create a vendor.js bundle containing angular with ngRoute and possibly other global vendor libraries which will be seperate from the bundled application js file.

### To Do ###

- [x] Get AngularJS working with ES6 module exports
- [x] Add ng-annotate-loader for production build
- [ ] Complete ESLint file .eslintrc
- [ ] Split `bundle.js` into `vendor.js` & `app.js`
- [ ] CV Page
- [ ] Contact Page

#### CV Page ####

- [ ] Setup Distant Server with Database
- [ ] Design Layout
- [ ] Service to fetch cv info from database
- [ ] Get it working with angular directives or components

#### Contact Page ####

- [ ] Design Layout
- [ ] Setup Node-mailer server
- [ ] Ping service to keep distant server up
